Getting started
To use clangd, you need:

clangd installed
a plugin for your editor
to tell clangd how your project is built
Installing clangd

Installing the clangd package will usually give you a slightly older version.

Try to install the latest packaged release (9.0):

sudo apt-get install clangd-9
If thatâ€™s not found, at least clangd-9 or clangd-8 should be available. Versions before 8 were part of the clang-tools pacakge.

This will install clangd as /usr/bin/clangd-9. Make it the default clangd:

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clangd clangd /usr/bin/clangd-9 100
