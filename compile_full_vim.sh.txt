If you want to be able to easily uninstall vim use checkinstall.

sudo apt install checkinstall
cd ~/vim
sudo checkinstall
Otherwise, you can use make to install.

cd ~/vim
sudo make install

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor /usr/local/bin/vim 1
sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/local/bin/vim
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/vi vi /usr/local/bin/vim 1
sudo update-alternatives --set vi /usr/local/bin/vim

 Double check that you are in fact running the new Vim binary by looking at
the output of vim --version.

If you don't get gvim working (on ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS), try changing --enable-gui=gtk2 to --enable-gui=gnome2

If you have problems, double check that you configured using the correct Python config directory, as noted at the beginning of Step 3.

These configure and make calls assume a Debian-like distro where Vim's runtime files directory is placed in /usr/share/vim/vim80/, which is not Vim's default. Same thing goes for --prefix=/usr in the configure call. Those values may need to be different with a Linux distro that is not based on Debian. In such a case, try to remove the --prefix variable in the configure call and the VIMRUNTIMEDIR in the make call (in other words, go with the defaults).

if when compiling you get this kind of error 
While installing Vim on Linux through GNOME Terminal (having downloaded the Github repository) this error appears: "warning: ‘GTimeVal’ is deprecated: Use 'GDateTime' instead [-Wdeprecated-declarations]".

The error seems to go into an infinite loop of attempting to continue the install, however it is always halted.

Within the following files, simply put ":%s/GTimeVal/GDateTime/g" in Normal Mode (w/out quotes, obviously); sudo will be required.

/usr/include/glib-2.0/glib/gtypes.h
/usr/include/gtk-2.0/gtk/gtktooltips.h

While there are more "GTimeVal" variables in files throughout the GTK2 file structure, Vim's install does not seem to touch any more than the preceding two files.

(Or using GTK 3 might be another option.)
